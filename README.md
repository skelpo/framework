Skelpo Framework - Next Generation Web Development
========================================

Why have another framework? This is probably what you ask yourself now. The reason
is simple: Because none of the existing ones put together what you really need.

Skelpo Frameworks combines to the following technologies into one framework:

Server-Sided
--------------
- PHP 7 (5.6 is minimum)
- [http://symfony.com/](symfony 3)
- [http://www.doctrine-project.org/](doctrine)
- [http://www.smarty.net/](smarty)
- MySQL (or any doctrine compatible database for that matter)

Frontend-Sided
--------------
- [http://foundation.zurb.com/](ZURB Foundation)
- [http://getbootstrap.com/](Bootstrap)
- [https://angular.io/](AngularJS 2.0)
- [http://www.typescriptlang.org/](TypeScript)

To put it simple: Skelpo Framework is not inventing much new, it is simply putting
together everything that's been proven helpful. 

What should be said though is, this framework is not trying to "allow" you to do whatever
you want with it. Symfony (and other frameworks) are actively trying to give enough space
so that you can write any kind of application with it. Skelpo Framework aims to help you
write specifically Progressive Web Apps and modern websites that are based of the frameworks
mentioned above. This framework makes it a lot easier for you to build controllers, models and the 
related frontend views and connects them directly. However, it does not provide you a framework
"like" symfony, but uses such a framework to provide you enhanced support to connect with
other beautiful frameworks

Example: You want to build a webapp with AngularJS 2.0 (meaning TypeScript) and you love
using symfony. Our framework has everything prepared for you to start building right away.

Another example: You want to build an advanced website with Bootstrap or Foundation and you
don't want to spend much time setting up symfony or zend. Our framework's got you covered!

Installation / Usage
--------------------

The framework is installed via composer

    ``` json
    {
        "require": {
            "skelpo/framework": ">=1.1.0"
        }
    }
    ```
